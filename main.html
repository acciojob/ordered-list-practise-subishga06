    <h2>ðŸ’» Code Optimization Techniques</h2>

    <p>We can optimize a solution using both **time** and **space** optimization. To optimize a program, the primary considerations are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied. This is often a **time-space trade-off**.</li>
        <li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase its total run time. This is also a **time-space trade-off**.</li>
        <li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying **relevant algorithms** and efficient data structures.</li>
    </ol>
